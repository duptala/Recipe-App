## Recipe App Overview 🍔

The Recipe App is a MERN stack project designed to showcase the capabilities of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. While the primary goal is to serve as a practical learning experience in React development, the application also tries to integrate the utility of Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **Recipe Browsing**: Easily browse through a collection of recipes.
- **Recipe Details**: View detailed instructions, ingredients, and preparation time.
- **Recipe Uploads**: Upload own personalised recipies.
- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login functionality.
- **User Profiles**: Personalized user experience with saved recipes and preferences.

## Motivation

This project was inspired out of a desire to deepen my understanding of React and the MERN stack. It serves a dual purpose: 
1. As a learning tool, allowing me to experiment with and implement various features using the MERN stack.
2. As a functional application that can be expanded upon in the future, potentially serving as a personal recipe hub or a collaborative platform for food enthusiasts.
